There are various platform specific and cross platform GUI frameworks.

Windows
1. Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC)

2. In case of C++/CLI go for .NET (WinForm)

LINUX
1. GTK and GTK+
These are C libraries with C++ wrappers available for them.

Cross Platform
1. QT Framework
It is best cross platform framework IMO. It covers GUI, graphics, network, file system etc. QT Creator allows you to build GUI by drag and drop (similar to Visual Studio).

2. WxWidget
I have never used personally, but reviews are good.
