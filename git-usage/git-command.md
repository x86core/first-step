t add <files>
To commit them:

$ git commit
To commit unstaged but changed files:

$ git commit -a
To push to a repository (say origin):

$ git push origin
To push only one of your branches (say master):

$ git push origin master
To fetch the contents of another repository (say origin):

$ git fetch origin
To fetch only one of the branches (say master):

$ git fetch origin master
To merge a branch with the current branch (say other_branch):

$ git merge other_branch
Note that origin/master is the name of the branch you fetched in the previous step from origin. Therefore, updating your master branch from origin is done by:

$ git fetch origin master
$ git merge origin/master
